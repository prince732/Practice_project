Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) on Sunday hit out at the BJP, accusing the party of using references to religion and the Army to win state elections.

KCR said that the Army, and not BJP, should be credited for carrying out surgical strikes in Pakistan in response to the Uri attack in 2016.
